# Fizz Buzz Challenge

## Challenge: 

Your challenge is to write some tests for the FizzBuzz game.

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that is often asked as an interview question. Create a function called fizzBuzz. This function should take in number as a parameter. The function should do the following:

If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then return "FizzBuzz"
If the number is divisible by 3, then return "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, then return "Buzz"
Else just return the number
Write a set of tests that pass in various values to the FizzBuzz function and ensure that the function meets the above requirements. Make sure that you test all different "types" of inputs that the function may receive.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
